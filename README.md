# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
My project was aimed at studying the relationship and discovering the relationship between impacted species, number of strikes, and cost incurred.

Tableau tools used:

- Sets
- Parameters
- Heirarchies
- Calculated Fields
- Quick table calculation

I focused on discovering the relationship between impacted species, number of strikes, and cost incurred with the following questions: 

1. Which state had the highest number of strikes over the years?
2. General trend for species impacted by aircraft collisions?
3. Which wildlife species group has been impacted most by the number of strikes?
4. Top N wildlife species with most costly strikes.
5. Trend of number of strikes vs cost incurred over the years.
6. Most costly phase of flight vs number of strikes.
    A: The most costly phase of strike is the climb whereas most strikes happen in the approaching phase.


I discovered the following insights: 
1. California had the hihest number of cumulative wildlife strikes over the years.
2. Birds have the highest collision strikes followed by Terrestrial mammals by a huge difference. 
3. Doves have been affected the most with the highest strike numbers.
4. Canadian Goose had the most costly collisions with aircrafts.
5. The most costly strikes happened in 2014 whereas the most costly year was 2009.
6. The most costly phase of strike is the climb whereas most strikes happen in the approaching phase.


## Challenges 
It is hard to streamline data visualizations to one area when there are so many interesting aspects within the dataset that can side track the analysis. 


## Future Goals
1. I want to connect Tableau with external sources to assess the relationship between wildlife strikes and migratory bird populations.
2. I hope to create different dashboards using the same data set to discover other insights using other key features of the dataset.
